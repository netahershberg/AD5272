How to activate AD5272 with I2C&amp;python using FTDI's  function

### ðŸ”Œ Part 1 â€“ Initialize FTDI Communication
In this setup, we used **FTDI** as the communication interface.  
While not mandatory, FTDI was part of the environment I worked with, enabling a bridge between the PC and the target device.  

Through the FTDI lines, we implemented **IÂ²C communication**, mapping the pins to act as **SDA** and **SCL**.  
This allowed the computer to drive IÂ²C transactions directly to the physical bus.

ðŸ“· Below is the schematic illustrating the connection.




**This video demonstrates the IÂ²C write sequence to the AD5272 digital potentiometer, captured using a Saleae Logic Analyzer.  
It highlights the process of choosing the right slave address selection  according to your setup on - board\matrix and shows the data bytes being transmitted over the bus.**
