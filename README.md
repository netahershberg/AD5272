# AD5272 C++\python
📝 How to activate AD5272 with I2C&amp;python using FTDI's  function

This repository focuses on the **software side** of communicating with the **AD5272 digital potentiometer** using **FTDI** and both **C++ and Python** implementations.  
⚡ Before using the software, make sure that your AD5272 is properly **wired to the correct FTDI pins** and powered according to the datasheet.

🔹 Features
- C++ examples for I²C communication with AD5272
- Python scripts for testing and automation
- Flow diagrams and documentation for initialization & command sequences
- Support for writing RDAC and control registers

🔹 Requirements
- FTDI module (I²C capable)
- C++ compiler (MSVC / GCC / Clang)
- swig interface to connect C++ program to python

### 🔌 Part 1 – Initialize FTDI Communication
🔄 In this setup, we used **FTDI** as the communication interface.  
While not mandatory, FTDI was part of the environment I worked with, enabling a bridge between the PC and the target device as well for other peripherals on board.

🖧 Through the FTDI lines, we implemented **I²C communication**, using FTDI all-ready made function(which I'll explain ater here) mapping the pins to act as **SDA** and **SCL**.  
This allowed the computer to drive I²C transactions directly to the physical bus.

The first step is to work with the FTDI functions in C++. All the necessary functions can be found in this repository — the main changes are under i2c_test.cpp, where you’ll need to adjust the I²C address according to your setup and the data (words) you want to send.

📐 Below is the schematic illustrating the connection.
